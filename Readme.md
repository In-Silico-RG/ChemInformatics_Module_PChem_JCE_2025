Professor Guide: Cheminformatics Drug Analysis Notebook

📋 Overview
This Jupyter notebook provides students with hands-on experience in cheminformatics, exploring relationships between chemical structure and biological activity using computational tools. Students analyze common drugs from two therapeutic classes (NSAIDs and antibiotics) while developing practical skills in molecular visualization, descriptor calculation, and data analysis.

🎯 Learning Objectives
By completing this activity, students will be able to:

Retrieve and visualize chemical structures of bioactive molecules using Python
Calculate key physicochemical descriptors using RDKit
Analyze correlations between molecular properties and biological activity
Apply Lipinski's Rule of Five to assess drug-likeness
Visualize and analyze 3D molecular structures
Develop scientific programming and data analysis skills
